# Coding conventions
These are some initial code conventions to mantain a coherent style.

All names for classes, methods and functions must be in **english**

## Variable names, classes and methods
Variable names should be **CamelCase**

Names always start with an uppercase letter. No use of spaces or underscore. Use an uppercase letter to start each words. Names must be meaningful and help the reader to understand the code. Don't use names like: test, prueba, etc.

All variable names **MUST BE IN ENGLISH**.

## Members
Member variables in classes must start with **m** to hint member of a class. For example mHealth is correct. Members must not start with _ or any other lower case letter different from m
